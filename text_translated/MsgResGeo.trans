What's this<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>?
Now I know!
This is Jenny's trivet for<N>putting the pot on.
Anyway...
For us...
Every single day...
Is just cleaning and cleaning.
We never have<N>the time to play.
Once in a while...
We should try<N>playing a little...
Don't you think the<N>nighttime is so calm?
It makes me feel uneasy<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
I- <1a078004000a00>It's not like I'm scared<N>or anything though.
But... <1a078004000a00>Look<1a078004000a00>, there's suddenly a<N>sound and something comes out.
And then it just disappears right<N>in front of your eyes again<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
That's what makes<N>me feel so uneasy<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
When I think about it... <1a078004000a00>We've come<N>to a rather high-up place, huh?
That area over there<N>is still rather dirty.
If you have some time over<N>you should clean it up!
As expected from you, Chibi-Robo!<N>It's very clean!
That makes me feel at ease!
That area over there is<N>extremely dirty.
We still need to<N>put in more effort.
Is that... <1a078004000a00>Iberico?
Ibericooo!
Oh, sorry.<N>It wasn't him.
Oh, sorry.<N>It was just some trash.
I didn't notice.
Hmm?<N>There's a string over...
Oh! <1a078004000a00>It's the ventilation fan!
<1a0a8002000101010304>Chibi-Robo?<1a0a8002000000000000>
<1a0a8002000101010304>It couldn't be<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>!<1a0a8002000000000000>
You're playing hide-and-seek?!
And it looks like I'm ''it''<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
You shouldn't start playing without<N>saying something first!
Wherever you're hiding...
I'll find you in no time<N>from up in the air!

<1a06ff000004>Touch to struggle!
<1a0680010003><1a0680000000><1a06ff000003>!!!<1a0680000003>

*Argh*<1a078004000a00> *Argh*
<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
You<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
<1a0680010003>Don't beat me up<1a0680010002><N>from my insides!
Anyway...<N>You're stupidly hard to chew!
How are you planning on repaying<N>me if my fangs break!?
<1a0680010003>Chibi-Robo!<N>Are you okay!?<1a0680010002>
<1a0680010001><1a0680000014>Chibi-Robo?<1a0680010002><1a0680000003>

So rude to a lady...
Well... <1a078004000a00>Jenny likes you,<N>so I guess I'll tell you.
The master of watery roads!
The butterfly of the evening!

I <1a078004000a00>can't help but<N>find this strange.
It's all so suspicious.
But I don't want to <1a078004000a00>argue<1a078004001e00> with<N>Mesa. It makes me feel bad.
That outfit<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
If only there was <1a06ff000003>no water<1a06ff00000d>,<N>then we could grab it<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
Let's somehow triumph<N>over Mesa's tricks...

Don't forget that<N>you're <1a06ff000003>weak to water<1a06ff00000d>!

I guess I can tell you guys...
That fight or whatever,<N>it's such an obvious lie.
I can tell cause he's always<N>just playing around.
He should show some signs of<N>seriousness from time to time.

What's up with him?
Ever since he came back he's<N>been covering his face.
Oh well, <1a078004000a00>it has nothing<N>to do with me.

Ooh, <1a078004000a00>I love making fun of him.
W- <1a078004000a00>Way too mean!
Oh, <1a078004000a00>I just remembered.<N>I have a date soon!
See you.
That mean person<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003> Or rather... <N><1a078004000a00>That shark should back off.
Let's go back to where<N>the mask was!

I- <1a078004000a00>I- <1a078004000a00>It's alright!

Let's go ASAP!<N>As soon as possible, that is!

Did you call for help!?
We asked Habanero<N>for help, but<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
So <1a078004000a00>where is he?
He began running for your rescue<N>without knowing the location.
That idiot<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
<1a0680010003>I'M NOT AN IDIOT!<1a0680010002>
It took a 100 years for<N>me to get here!
But, after having gone through<N>5 rooms, I finally found you!
<1a06ff000004>*Shrrr*

That went well!
I- <1a078004000a00>Incredible!
You're forgetting<N>something important.
I do? <1a078004000a00>What?
<1a0680010003>MY RESCUE!<1a0680010002>

Please hurry up and save me!
<1a0680010003>Ow-ow-ow-ow!<1a0680010002>
What are you doing!?
Just as I thought...
You really are hopeless.

What I said was so<N>embarrassing...
It didn't fit my<N>character at all<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>

I've been wanting to eat a<N>tomato for a while now.
<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>But. I don't have<N>any teeth anymore.
<1a0680010003><1a0a8002000103030203>It's a miracle!!<1a0a8002000000000000><1a0680010002>
What is!?
Look at this!
H<1a078004000a00>- H<1a078004000a00>- H<1a078004000a00>-.<1a078004000a00>.<1a078004000a00>.<N>How!?
Did you<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003><1a078004000000><1a078004001400><N><1a0680010003>Did you steal those!?<1a0680010002>
No way I'd do that!
Surely, <1a078004000a00>this is all<N>thanks to the guitar!
I'm so glad!
So, <1a078004000a00>what are you<N>waiting for?
<1a0680010003>???<1a0680010002>
<1a0680010003>Hurry!<1a0680010002><N>Bring me a <1a06ff000009>Tomato<1a06ff00000d>!
A red one, of course!

<1a0680010003>That's it〜!<N>Gimme gimme!<1a0680010002>
It has a strange color, but<N><1a078004000a00>I'll eat it anyway!
I don't want any spicy ones!


You thought that attack<N>would work on me?
*Puuh*...<N>It finally settled down.
Anyway, <1a078004000a00>you! Just what<N>did you give me!?
Next time you make me eat<N>something strange like that...
Then I'll make you pay!
Oooh! <1a078004000f00>That's so irritating!
Stop doing that!
How about you go and pester that<N>stupid teacher of yours instead!?
Oooh! <1a078004000f00>That's so irritating!
I'm already wet enough!
What?<N>You brought a gun?
Is it really that strange<N>to not have any fangs!?
<1a0680010003>What!?<1a0680010002> Are you going to<N>make fun of me too!?
I need my fangs more than<N>I need to be wet!!
Get that cold water<N>away from me!
.<1a078004001900>.<1a078004001900>.<1a078004001900>What's with the jokes?
If you're done with<N>the jokes...
Then <1a078004000a00>hurry up and<N>help me instead!

Oh,<1a078004000a00> that's a nice tune.
But,<1a078004000a00> it's all in vain...
Since there's no way I'm<N>showing my moves to that. ♪
Oh,<1a078004000a00> that's a nice tune.
Huh?<1a078004000a00> Are you<1a078004000a00> hitting on me?
That's such a beautiful melody...<N>It feels like it's healing me.
<1a0680000014>...<1a0680000003>Wait.<N>It really has!?
Are you making fun<N>of me indirectly?!
Stop that strumming,<N><1a0680010003>YOU IDIOT!<1a0680010002>
<1a0680000014>...<1a0680000003>But it did heal me a bit.
Oh,<1a078004000a00> that's a nice tune.
Saying what's on your mind<N>really makes you feel good.
You<1a078004000a00> should try it<N>out sometime.
Hey you<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
Did you come here<N>just to say that?
S- <1a078004001400>Sorry!
<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>If you're here to apologize,<N>then don't bother.
Ooooh<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003><N>That's <1a078004000a00>super!
The gracious guitar!
Hm<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
Somehow my <1a06ff000003>mouth<N>feels a bit better<1a06ff00000d><1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>

Oh,<1a078004000a00> that outfit is so unstylish.
But you know...
Oh,<1a078004000a00> that outfit is so unstylish.
Anyway...
Hey, you're an officer.<N>Please find my fangs<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>!
Oh, it's just you Chibi-Robo!

Oh,<1a078004000a00> that outfit is so unstylish.<N><1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>*Sigh*

<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>Well, that's an<N>unfashionable look.
Anyway<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
It's like you have no clue<N>what you're wearing.
Are you seeking respect?
Oooh<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003> Well, then I'll<N>teach you something nice.
I'll teach you something nice.
It's like you have no clue<N>what you're wearing.
Are you seeking respect?
Well... <1a078004000a00>It doesn't matter.
Anyway...

Oh, it's just you Chibi-Robo!
That outfit...
Do you want to become<N>an idiot too!?
Anyway...
That outfit<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003><N>Isn't it rather stupid<1a068000000a>...?<1a0680000003>
Oh, <1a078004000a00>that's stylish<1a068000000a>....<1a0680000003><N>Not!

Oh,<1a078004000a00> that outfit is so unstylish.<N><1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>*Sigh*

This tomato looks delicious<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
But,<1a078004000a00> I won't taste it!<N>You're too stiff!
It messed me up before.
Anyway...
This tomato looks delicious<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
Not.
This tomato looks delicious<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>
Not.
I can't eat this tomato<1a068000000a>...<1a0680000003>

Jenny got so<N>dressed up...
But that's not all...
She also got to show it<N>off at a nice wedding...
Even if I don't like that,<N>I can't stop thinking about it.
